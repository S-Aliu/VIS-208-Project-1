            <p class="card-text">1/31/22</p>
            <p class="card-text"><small class="text-muted"> I found Shaw's reflections on connecting to learning to be quite relatable. Especially
            as a college student navigating an overwhelming wealth of crucial information both
            on and off of the internet, I find myself losing track of a lot of it. However in many ways
            the measure of the humanity of our information ecology is subjective. Especially
            today, the internet is most definitely one of the greatest learning tools. The way
            we consume content is personal and so also is the extent to which one might find
            that content consumption is and does inherently feel like learning. I would argue that thanks to those tools
            and resources one may access through an internet connection it is indeed possible reflect on books
            read months apart, for example, by using your favorite search engine to look for a book summary or
            creating a running list of favorite quotes though which you could then easily run a word search on at any moment.
            I think this also leads into why software development is interesting: its essentially the process of approaching
            problems such as the humanity of internet learning and developing a concrete set of tools to navigate the issue.

            Another interesting idea that myself, Tindar, and Mikayla discussed is the idea that today links are more than
            the presence of an anchor tag. Be it a hashtag or the decision made from a search engine, when we consider
            the internet and how not only sites but ideas are linked, we may find that they are more interconnected and
            two-way than we may have initially thought.</small></p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Entry #2: Reflections on the Internet </h5>
            <p class="card-text">2/7/22</p>
            <p class="card-text"><small class="text-muted"> When I first learned or encountered the idea of servers, search engines, and even websites as interactions between computers
            I soon realized that the internet was not what I thought it was, but never took time to reflect on my new perception of the internet.
            When I was much younger I would have said the internet was similar to a program that my individual computer runs locally, but that
            is clearly not the case, in listening to "A History of the Internet" by Laurel Schwulst I resonate with the conceptual overview of the internet as
            being a group of computers in many ways, but I know that it is much more complicated than that.
            Especially as technology advances so also does their become more a spectrum of how much of a machine access the internet, helps to
            run the internet, or simply stores information which through another device is then transported to the internet. In ECE 206 learning
            how simple circuits such as a SR latch are fundamental building blocks for more large scale memory store such as SRAM or a register file
            further cemented an idea that I also found pretty found and that is also mentioned in the aforementioned talk which is that the Internet
            IS physical. Even though I always find that creating a website or putting content online may be referred to digitizing something or putting it
            in a virtual space, changes information correspond to physical changes such as a change in current or voltage.  So also then I have come to realize that
            in many ways digitizing resources may for example mean for me not having to buy a physical textbook, and yet on the other hand I am using and
            changing the internet and dispelling an amount of energy and power that is much more difficult to trace. Given these thoughts
            seeing the article on the environmental toll of Netflix confirmed my shift in perspective on the internet and the importance of resource efficient
            algorithms.

            Another concept that I have not thought about more intentionally but definitely observed is the idea that increasingly many platforms are incorporating
            feeds on the landing or main page of the website. Listing to Anil Dash discuss this in his "The Web We Lost" was interesting as the talk was almost a
            decade ago, and yet newer sites and especially apps spend a lot of time personalizing and showcasing the feed throughout the user's experience.
            Companies with web-/app- based products that have feeds that draw and keep the users attention are both common and incredibly successful.


            I found the article to Reboot the world to also be incredibly interesting. I wasn't aware that the app mentioned in the article (called Ashley Madison)
            existed. Given that the app was made to facilitate affairs, I can only imagine the consequences of the data break. Today data breaches or more common
            and right now many big companies have so much more data on us that its harder for a user to consider and fully consent to the various processes
            used in collecting our data. Even though many companies go the extra mile to empower the user to understand the data being taken from them
            the largest tech companies today fail to in many ways and continue to profit off of the wealth of information that have at their hands.</small></p>
